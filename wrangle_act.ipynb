    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focused on wrangling data from the WeRateDogs Twitter account using Python, documented in a Jupyter Notebook (wrangle_act.ipynb). This Twitter account rates dogs with humorous commentary. The rating denominator is usually 10, however, the numerators are usually greater than 10.\n",
    "[They’re Good Dogs Brent](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/theyre-good-dogs-brent)\n",
    "wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for us to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to wrangle the WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. The challenge lies in the fact that the Twitter archive is great, but it only contains very basic tweet information that comes in JSON format. I needed to gather, asses and clean the Twitter data for a worthy analysis and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Enhanced Twitter Archive\n",
    "\n",
    "The WeRateDogs Twitter archive contains basic tweet data for all 5000+ of their tweets, but not everything. One column the archive does contain though: each tweet's text, which I used to extract rating, dog name, and dog \"stage\" (i.e. doggo, floofer, pupper, and puppo) to make this Twitter archive \"enhanced.\".We manually downloaded this file manually by clicking the following link: [twitter_archive_enhanced.csv](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/August/59a4e958_twitter-archive-enhanced/twitter-archive-enhanced.csv)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Data via the Twitter API\n",
    "\n",
    "Back to the basic-ness of Twitter archives: retweet count and favorite count are two of the notable column omissions. Fortunately, this additional data can be gathered by anyone from Twitter's API. Well, \"anyone\" who has access to data for the 3000 most recent tweets, at least. But we, because we have the WeRateDogs Twitter archive and specifically the tweet IDs within it, can gather this data for all 5000+. And guess what? We're going to query Twitter's API to gather this valuable data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Image Predictions File\n",
    "\n",
    "he tweet image predictions, i.e., what breed of dog (or other object, animal, etc.) is present in each tweet according to a neural network. This file (image_predictions.tsv) hosted on Udacity's servers and we downloaded it programmatically using python Requests library on the following (URL of the file: https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/August/599fd2ad_image-predictions/image-predictions.tsv)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "Key points to keep in mind when data wrangling for this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We only want original ratings (no retweets) that have images. Though there are 5000+ tweets in the dataset, not all are dog ratings and some are retweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fully assessing and cleaning the entire dataset requires exceptional effort so only a subset of its issues (eight (8) quality issues and two (2) tidiness issues at minimum) need to be assessed and cleaned.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cleaning includes merging individual pieces of data according to the rules of tidy data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The fact that the rating numerators are greater than the denominators does not need to be cleaned. This unique rating system is a big part of the popularity of WeRateDogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We do not need to gather the tweets beyond August 1st, 2017. We can, but note that we won't be able to gather the image predictions for these tweets since we don't have access to the algorithm used.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Project Details\n",
